# Tezos Pixel War

This repo contains the source code for the Tezos Pixel War (season 1), which as an experiment I did
to see what it takes to launch a Tezos Smart Rollup from start to finish.

## The Kernel DOES NOT follow several best practices. Do not use this hot garbage code.

The purpose of this project was for fun and learning, not safety. There are many,
many issues with this code and if you copy it without understanding people will notice and break it.

I'm available for hire to write a rock-solid rollup kernel though. See my Github profile for
several ways to contact me.
