        Building this thing on bleeding-edge tech isn't easy. Help me justify
        the time invested in this community project.
      </p>
      <p>
        To raise the money, I've built a Kickstarter-like smart contract. Check
        out the{" "}

        .
      </p>
      <p> Here's how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          During the fundraising period, anyone can pledge any amount of tez
          toward the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          At any point during the fundraising period, you can cancel your
          pledge. After 2 hours, your pledge is fully refunded.
        </li>
        <li>
          If enough money is raised, I'll post a commitment on-chain to ship
          Season 2 within 5 weeks{" "}
          <small>(I can only do part-time work on it)</small>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If I can get enough money pledged, I commit to shipping Season 2 by
          July 1st, 2023.

          <ul>
            <li>If I did, I keep the money. Enjoy your Pixel War.</li>
            <li>If I did not, you can collect a full refund. No sweat.</li>

          fixture in the Tezos art community.
